It's been a month (and three days) since I started my fellowship at The Washington Post. In a word, I've spent the month building. In a few more words I've been building things, building projects, and building skills. 

<h2>Building Things</h2>

At the end of these ten months, I want to be able to look back and see concrete <em>things</em> that I made. Here are a few little projects I've built so far:

<strong><a href = "https://github.com/bchartoff/equalhalves">Equalhalves:</a></strong> A few weeks ago, <a href = "http://www.businessinsider.com/us-gdp-map-2014-2">this map</a> splitting the US GPD in half. It's got problems (short version, it's basically a population map, compare to <a href = "http://www.theatlanticcities.com/design/2012/12/mapping-census-dot-every-person/4273/">this</a>). In a chat about this map in the #opennews IRC room, <a href = "https://github.com/knowtheory">Ted Han</a>offhandedly mentioned it would be cool to see lines which split the population of the US in half. I thought it would be cool too, so I built a project that found them. It was a lot of fun. The <a href = "https://github.com/bchartoff/equalhalves/blob/0a733d537db252977693d6865822f6c473ab5a9f/output.png">quick and dirty</a> version drew straight lines across the US. At this scale, there's a ton of data loss caused by the curvature of the Earth, so I decided to spend a day rebuilding the script to draw great circles instead of lines (the trig is fun and you should <a href = "http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html">check it out</a>).

<strong><a href = "https://github.com/bchartoff/githubchild">Githubchild:</a></strong> This was an afternoon's work (yesterday) that sprung from a twitter conversation with <a href = "https://github.com/gotoplanb">Dave Stanton</a> a few days ago. He asked twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Are there a <a href="https://twitter.com/github">@github</a> web shortcuts to go next/prev through commit history?</p>&mdash; Dave Stanton (@gotoplanb) <a href="https://twitter.com/gotoplanb/statuses/440872720260411392">March 4, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It turns out that github has some keyboard shortcuts, including "p" to view the parent commit of the commit you're currently viewing. Github doesn't have a "view child" shortcut, which makes sense for large, complex repos &mdash; traversing up (child &rarr; parent) the commit tree fundamentally converges (in general) while traversing down (parent &rarr; child) might lead down far flung divergent branches. That being said, it makes sense for relatively simple repos to be able to travel in both directions. I wrote this little function in javascript to press "c" to move parent &rarr; child. It's probably a work in progress, since it's a bit slow. Right now I'm calling to the github API once per page load &mdash; I should really speed things up by storing parent:child pairs in local storage, or making a call to a python based server. Soon.

<strong><a href = "https://github.com/bchartoff/crimescrape">Crimescrape:</a></strong> This is a small scraper I built for <a href = "https://twitter.com/tmellnik">Ted Mellnik</a>, a database editor in the graphics department here at the Post. It pulls down DC crime statistics from <a href ="http://crimemap.dc.gov/CrimeMapSearch.aspx">the DC crime map</a> by navigating a few forms, dropdowns, checkboxes, etc. I wrote it a while back, but just put it up on github a few days ago. While it's certainly single-use, many of the concepts might be useful to check out. In the README, I spelled out the entire process of hosting and running this script. For example, check out how I ran Firefox on a remote Ubuntu server, using a headless browser. Fun times.

All told, these projects took maybe a week of my time so far. So what else have I been up to? Lots.

<h2>Building Projects</h2>

I've got a number of ongoing projects in the works, some of which will get their own blog posts down the line. Instead of another laundry list of projects, here are some lessons I've learned about how to Get Stuff Done as a fellow in a newsroom.

<h4>Get off the laptop</h4>

It's easy to get tunnel vision on a project, and code away in isolation all day. But (most of the time) that's not the best way to get stuff built. Almost all of the projects I've accrued have been pitched, developed, and/or fleshed out while I'm away from my desk. I go to meetings (so far with the Design team (specifically their "code" meetings with <a href = "https://github.com/katiepark">some</a> <a href = "https://github.com/eschow">of</a> <a href = "http://darlacameron.com/">the</a> <a href = "https://github.com/kennelliott">most</a> <a href = "https://github.com/denisedslu">amazing</a> folks I've ever had the pleasure of working with), the Politics desk, Local desk, and scattered other teams and folks), I go ask questions, or I just stand over people's shoulders and see what they're up to (it's not as creey as it sounds, I promise).

It's worth mentioning that I've applied these same practices without actually leaving my desk (just getting off the metaphorical laptop, if you will). Two of the projects I mentioned above came from ideas on Twitter and IRC (and from sources outside of my own newsroom). The Post also makes great use of chat (specifically HipChat) for keeping teams in constant contact.

<h4>Work with people who want to work with me</h4>

While I tried to come to the Post with as few expectations as possible, I had certain ideas about who I might work with on projects. Over the past month, I've been realizing that

<h2>Building Skills</h2>

I want to be blogging more. I didn't put this in the lede (look me all journalistic) because I hate how often blog posts &mdash; especially personal blog posts &mdash; start off with some variation of "it's been a while, internet!". This blog should be about getting you, the reader, as excited about this fellowship as I am. So no apologies up front, just enthusiasm and ideas. That being said, I initially planned on weekly posts, and I've certainly had something to talk about every week I've been here. In theory posting frequency will increase, stay tuned.
