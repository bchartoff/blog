Last weekend I attended <a href = "http://pdfliberation.wordpress.com/">the PDF Liberation Hackathon</a> at the <a href = "http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/11/15/opengov-voices-pdf-liberation-hackathon-at-sunlight-in-dc-and-around-the-world-january-17-19-2014/">Sunlight Foundation</a> here in DC. It was a wonderful event, and a great kick-off to my fellowship year in the District. I want to talk about it a little, in part because it was objectively awesome, and in part because it was my <em>very first hackathon!</em>

<h2>The event</h2>

The DC event was huge. ~80 people registered and around ~40 were at Sunlight on Saturday and Sunday. A few groups formed naturally, with a plurality of people using various OCR tools (that's <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">Optical Character Recognition</a>) to grab data from pdfs which didn't include text elements (scanned tax forms, as an example). People were working with <a href = "https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">Tesseract</a> quite a bit. The winning project, <a href = "https://github.com/pdfliberation/whatwordwhere">WhatWordWhere</a> implements Tesseract OCR extraction and GIS (geographic information systems) based methodology to build models of pdf layouts. <a href = "https://github.com/jsfenfen">Jacob Fenton</a> at Sunlight has been developing the project along with <a href = "https://github.com/boblannon">Bob Lannon</a>, and it's incredibly cool. Another large group was working on the bulk extraction of metadata from USAID Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC) reports, as outlined in <a href = "https://github.com/pdfliberation/pdf-hackathon/blob/master/challenges/usaid-challenge.md">this hackathon challenge</a>. A summary of their results is <a href = "https://github.com/pdfliberation/USAID-DEC">on github.</a>

<h2>What I did</h2>

I spent most of my time playing around with <a href = "http://tabula.nerdpower.org/">Tabula</a>, a tool for extracting tabular data from pdf's. I'd heard about the tool from one of last year's fellows, <a href = "https://mike.tig.as/">Mike Tigas</a>, who worked on the project. I spent most of Saturday with my head down, testing out Tabula and some other tabular extraction tools on a <a href = "https://github.com/jazzido/tabula-extractor/blob/master/test/data/sydney_disclosure_contract.pdf">simple test document</a>. Using Tabula's GUI, I ran into a problem where data on multiple lines within a cell (e.g. a street address in one cell but on three lines) was all extracted, but the line breaks weren't preserved. In the spirit of collaborative hacking, I tweeted at Mike, who was at the NYC location of the hackathon. He pinged me back on IRC, saying he'd talked to <a href = "https://github.com/jeremybmerrill">Jeremy Merrill</a>, another developer on Tabula who was also at the event, and learned that there was an option to preserve line breaks in Tabula's source code. Tabula can either be run: through its in-browser GUI, on the command line, or through direct implementation in Ruby &mdash; as is often the case the three options offer increasingly tighter control at the expense of decreasing ease-of-use. As of Saturday, the only way to pass "use_line_returns"  to Tabula was through a Ruby script, so I decided to write one, with the idea of including it as a sample script in Tabula's <a href = "https://github.com/jazzido/tabula-extractor/blob/master/test/tests.rb">tests.rb</a> (which serves as their Ruby documentation, for now).

It was far from a complicated project, but I'd never written a line of Ruby, so it took me a while to figure out the syntax and structure of my script. I got some great help from <a href = "https://github.com/konklone">Eric Mill</a> and <a href = "https://github.com/kaitlin">Kaitlin Devine</a>, two of my amazing former colleagues at Sunlight who were at the DC hackathon on Sunday, and by the end of the weekend I'd submitted a tiny <a href = "https://github.com/jazzido/tabula-extractor/commit/df7d08914ca834a667eecff1c41680ac7b7579e4">pull request</a> to add my test case to the Tabula docs. It was a small accomplishment, but it felt truly wonderful.

The conversation about use_line_returns bled into the NYC hackathon (or perhaps was happening in parallel), which resulted in an even easier fix to the line returns problem. A hacker at the New York event pushed <a href = "https://github.com/jazzido/tabula-extractor/commit/d6197616f7e1eecb3125bdc06a93185eb3238f9b">this commit</a> which allows users to pass the option to Tabula from the command line. I wouldn't be surprised to see that option in the Tabula GUI sometime soon.

<h2>What I learned</h2>

Nominally, I learned a little bit about Ruby and a little bit about Tabula. But really I re-learned a lesson that I <em>know</em> is true, but I still sometimes have trouble embracing.

<strong>Ask for help</strong>.

The community I'm part of &mdash; news nerds, civic hackers, whatever you want to call us &mdash; is made up of truly wonderful people, who are <em>deeply</em> committed to helping others learn. Maybe most developers are like this, but I don't think so. I think we are a self selecting group of tech-minded human beings who are passionate about spreading knowledge, sharing information, and increasing data literacy across the globe. The kind of people who want to help <em>everyone</em> live a better, more informed life, of course are the kind of people who want to help each other live as better coders, makers, and general badasses. When I tweeted at Eric for Ruby help on Sunday morning, I almost immediately got a chat on IRC from a complete stranger at the NYC event who was not just willing, but genuinely excited to help me out.

While I learned by doing &mdash; by writing code and digging through the tabula-extractor repo, stackoverflow threads, and Ruby docs &mdash; I never would have accomplished anything without asking for and receiving so much help. A hackathon is a wonderful way to bring so many amazing people into one room (or in this case a series of rooms), but that doesn't mean it's the only time to ask the community for help. Most of the help I received and conversations I had last weekend were on IRC, twitter, and github threads. It's great having people in a room together, but we can still communicate anytime and anywhere. A hackathon is a concentrated version of a normal project, but it exemplifies what this fellowship is all about. Talking to each other. Helping each other. Coding together.

<h2>What's coming on this blog</h2>

This is the first post on my blog documenting my year as a Knight Mozilla fellow. Maybe sometime soon I'll write something a bit more first-post-esque proclaiming my goals and hopes for the year, but I'd imagine a lot of my posts will follow a format similar to this one:
<ul>
<li>I did something cool/fun/hard/frustrating/inspiring/etc.</li>
<li>I learned something from it.</li>
<li> I can't wait to learn more.</li>
